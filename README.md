# Menstrual Cycle Wellness App

## Project Description

This application uses machine learning to analyze a user's menstrual cycle data and generate personalized recommendations for yoga sequences, breathwork exercises, and meditation. It utilizes the power of MongoDB Atlas on Google Cloud for data storage and management, Google's BigQuery for data analysis, and TensorFlow Enterprise for model training and prediction. 

This project was built as part of a hackathon, with the aim of using MongoDB Atlas and at least one Google Cloud Product.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Google Cloud SDK: Please follow this [guide](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) to download and install it.
- TensorFlow Enterprise: Install it using pip. If you have Python installed, you can simply run `pip install tensorflow`.
- MongoDB Atlas: A free-tier cluster on MongoDB Atlas is required. Follow this [guide](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/deploy-free-tier-cluster/) to set it up.
- Python: Make sure you have Python 3 installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Flask: Install it using pip. You can simply run `pip install flask`.
- Code Editor: Any preferred code editor. If you don't have a preferred one, Visual Studio Code is recommended. You can download it from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
